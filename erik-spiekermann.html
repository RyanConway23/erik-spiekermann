Spiekermann received a professorship at the Academy of Arts in Bremen, He also received an honorary doctorate for his input to Graphic Design at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, USA. He is also a member of the German Design Council.

				<p id="awards-text">In 2006 Spiekermann received a gold award at the German Federal Design Prize thus being the biggest award that can be presented. The judges declared Spiekermann’s typeface as a masterpiece as it spreads the German culture while having an updated and refined brand image which helps customers to intake information. 2001 showed a new chapter in Spiekermann’s career as he resigned from MetaDesign and founded another design agency ‘SpikermannPartners’. Some of their clients are Red Bull, Bosch, Cisco Systems and Nokia. Spiekermann merged with Eden Design in Amsterdam in 2009 to become ‘EdenSpiekermann’ which it is still currently known as. </p>

<p id="typeface-text" style="clear" both>In 2013 Spikermann created Fira Sans for the ‘Mozilla Firefox OS’ he got help from other designers such as Ralph du Carrois and Anja Meiners. Fira Sans can be linked to the Meta Typeface which was also designed by Spiekermann back in the 1980’s which is used by the ‘Mozilla Foundation’. Fira Sans has now become an open source project so others can develop the family even further with more weights and styles.</p>

	<div class="flex-container">
			<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
		<div class="flex-item">
			<p id="conclusion-text">Spiekermann who is currently 72 has officially retired from designing but his work and typefaces still play a role in society today. His approach to design is distinguishable and will continue to inspire others to follow in his footsteps. Spiekermann has left behind a legacy with his design agency ‘EdenSpiekermann’ which is globally available in Germany, America and the Netherlands and this allows companies and brands to get their own small touch of spiekermann’s style and passion in their work even though that he has retired. When it comes to his work with the German ‘Deutsche Bahn’ people have become familiarized with the new brands rebrand. His work with the ‘Fira Sans’ typeface is impactful and important to modern design as it has opened opportunity’s for other designers to contribute to the work of Spiekermann by making it a Open Source Project so more variations of his original typeface family can be added to, This is why I believe Erik Spiekermann had such an impact on Modern Design. </p>
